# Fashion Forward Forecasting - Data Science Pipeline Project

**Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Pipeline Project**

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for **StyleSense**, an online women's clothing retailer, to automatically predict customer product recommendations from fashion reviews.

### Problem Statement
StyleSense faces a backlog of product reviews with missing recommendation data. This ML pipeline analyzes review text, customer demographics, and product information to predict whether customers would recommend products, enabling automated sentiment analysis at scale.

## Key Features

‚úÖ **Complete ML Pipeline**: End-to-end preprocessing ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation  
‚úÖ **Mixed Data Types**: Handles numerical, categorical, and text features seamlessly  
‚úÖ **Advanced NLP**: TF-IDF vectorization with n-gram features and text preprocessing  
‚úÖ **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV across multiple models with cross-validation  
‚úÖ **High Performance**: Achieves 89.7% test accuracy and 93.8% F1-score  
‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Clean, modular code following best practices  

## Dataset

- **Size**: 18,442 fashion reviews
- **Features**: 8 input features (Age, Title, Review Text, Department, etc.)
- **Target**: Binary recommendation (1=Recommended, 0=Not Recommended)
- **Distribution**: 81.6% recommended, 18.4% not recommended

## Files

- **`starter.ipynb`** - Main Jupyter notebook with complete pipeline *(PRIMARY SUBMISSION FILE)*
- **`fashion_pipeline_simple.py`** - Standalone Python script for testing
- **`reviews.csv`** - Fashion review dataset
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies
- **`README_FASHION_PIPELINE.md`** - Detailed technical documentation

## Installation & Usage

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run Jupyter notebook (recommended)
jupyter notebook starter.ipynb

# Or run Python script
python fashion_pipeline_simple.py
```

### Required Packages
- scikit-learn
- pandas  
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Numerical**: StandardScaler for Age, Positive Feedback Count
- **Categorical**: OneHotEncoder for Division, Department, Class, Clothing ID
- **Text**: TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams for Title and Review Text

### 2. Model Training & Selection
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV with 3-fold cross-validation
- **Evaluation**: Train/test split (90%/10%) with comprehensive metrics

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Test Accuracy**: 89.70%
- **Test F1-Score**: 93.83%
- **Cross-Validation F1**: 93.88% ¬± 0.61%
- **Balanced Precision/Recall**: High performance across all metrics

## Technical Implementation

### ‚úÖ Udacity Requirements Satisfied

1. **Pipeline Structure**: Uses scikit-learn Pipeline and ColumnTransformer
2. **Data Type Handling**: Appropriate preprocessing for numerical, categorical, text
3. **NLP Techniques**: Text cleaning, TF-IDF, n-gram features
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful patterns from text
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV with cross-validation
6. **Model Evaluation**: Proper train/test split with comprehensive metrics
7. **Code Quality**: Clean, documented, modular functions

### Key Technical Highlights
- **Robust preprocessing pipeline** handling missing values and edge cases
- **Advanced text processing** with TF-IDF and n-gram extraction
- **Model comparison framework** enabling easy extension
- **Comprehensive evaluation** with multiple performance metrics
- **Production-ready architecture** with error handling and documentation

## Results & Business Impact

The pipeline successfully enables StyleSense to:
- **Automate recommendation prediction** for thousands of reviews
- **Scale customer sentiment analysis** without manual processing
- **Gain data-driven insights** into customer satisfaction patterns
- **Improve operational efficiency** and customer experience
